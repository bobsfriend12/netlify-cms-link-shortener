# netlify-cms-link-shortener

This is a web app that shortens links with the help of [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org).

## Deployment

1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit the `_data/siteinfo.json` file with your site's info.
3. Click the deploy to netlify button **IN YOUR REPO** if you click it in this repo then your sites info won't be here.

It is possible to use another host other than netlify, but that would require changing the code. Netlify is a great free hosting platform so why not use them?
